This is a repository of CodeWars challenges, called katas. I have completed 75+ challenges and pushed 5 solutions a week.

## How It's Made: 

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

I start each day with a new Codewars problem!

## Optimizations 

Each problem has been refactored for either efficiency and/or readability.

## Lessons Learned: 

My biggest takeaway from these daily challenges would be how I approach coding. I was able to recognize patterns between problems and apply those to similar ones I encountered later on. I was also exposed to lots of new ways of solving problems that broaden my understanding. I learned not to give up but to improve my googling abilities and let the knowledge of other engineers guide the way.

This is a repository of CodeWars challenges, called katas. I have completed 75+ challenges and pushed 7 solutions a week.

## How It's Made: 

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

I start each day with a new CodeWars problem!

## Optimizations 

Each problem has been refactored for either efficiency and/or readability.

## Lessons Learned: 

From these daily challenges I learned how to approach a coding problem. I was able to recognize patterns between problems and apply those to similar ones I encountered later on. I was also exposed to lots of new ways of solving a challenge that broaden my understanding.

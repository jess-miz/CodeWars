# CodeWars Challenges: <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/Jmiz" target="_blank">Visit Here!</a>
## How It's Made: 

**Tech used:** JavaScript

I start each day a new Codewar problem!

## Optimizations 

Each problem has been refactored for either efficiency and/or readability.

## Lessons Learned: 

My biggest takeaway from these daily challenges would be how I approach coding. I was able to recognize patterns between problems and apply those to similar ones I encountered later on. I also was exposed to lots of new methods and ways of solve problems that broaden my understanding. I learned not to give up but to improve my googling abilities and let the knowledge of other engineers guide the way.
